    <h1>AC Bookshelf Project</h1>
    <p>Problem-Solving through CAD, Fabrication, and FEA</p>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>The AC Bookshelf was designed to solve a practical issue: storing books above an air conditioning unit without obstructing ventilation or creating structural risks, while also filling the dead space where the wooden brace was sitting. The structure needed to be compact, sturdy, and able to support uneven weight distribution. This project initially stemmed from the fact that I had no good place to store the books I was reading, and I wanted to apply my learned CAD and finite element analysis skills to a real-world problem to find a real-world solution, as well as apply the concepts and content I had just learned in FEA, a course I took over the summer of 2025. </p>

      <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
      <p>After measuring available space and clearance, I designed a custom 3D printed bracket and shelf system that mounts around the AC unit, preserving airflow. CAD design was done in SolidWorks. When putting the model into Bambu Studio with my printer's specs, I realized that the original part would have to be split into two parts, creating two new complementary parts with their own studs and holes, and tolerancing to ensure a good fit. I went down to mine's maker space and printed out the shelf.</p>

      <h2>Final Implementation</h2>
      <p>It took a few attempts to get a successful print, but the final product was fabricated using a BambuLab X1 3D printer and promptly installed, holding over 15 lbs of books and gear without concern for deflection.</p>

      <h2>FEA Analysis</h2>
      <p>To validate structural integrity, I performed a finite element analysis in SolidWorks Simulation. The model was constrained at the mounting points and loaded with the expected maximum weight. Factor of safety (FOS) values were confirmed to be above 8.0, with acceptable displacement and von Mises stress levels for the 3D-printed PLA plastic. One inaccuracy with this model is the interior of the cross-sections; they are solid. In reality, they have a non-solid diamond infill, which I have loosely accounted for by doubling the simulated max load of 20 lbs (achieving that with books would be difficult). It is presently loaded with around 12 lbs of books, as shown in the Final Implementation, making it less prone to mechanical failure.</p>
